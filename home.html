              Brazil holds one of the largest biodiverse 
              ecosystems still unknown by men and a political and social system
              that attracts the interest of experts through all the world. This
              country has an unlimited potential to develop to a world power but
              never reaches this point because of the constant conflict between
              population and government. It greatly affects the way the country 
              can rise into a developed country. The government has since 2015 shown 
              low interest in its scientific department highly decreasing the funding 
              to research in the country.  In 30th March 2017 during President Michel 
              Temer declared budget cut decrease in the scientific sector. According to 
              The <i>Ministério da Fazenda</i>(Ministry of Finances) primary document[1] all 
              the departments faced a decrease, the MCTIC( Ministry of Science, Technology, 
              Innovations and Communications) lost 43.70% of its funding. From the R$ 5 
              Billion for 2017, only  2.2 billion was received. This emerged problem and 
              the actual economic situation in Brazil, a political and social crisi, 
              can result in immeasurable problems in the country - and in the world - 
              but The <i>Ministério do Planejamento</i>(Ministry of planning) still states 
              about a new decrease of 40%  in 2018. This event marks a historical stagnation, 
              and future delay, in Brazil’s development. Brazilians are unsure of their 
              country’s future, the level of education and, consequently, fairness, will 
              decrease, the global research department will delay and other global economic 
              relationship will change in consequence.  
              Not only did the national institutions feel scraped by the government 
              but also their higher literate population feel that they seems to be 
              fools because their government execute dramatic changes without 
              consulting their assent. Many of the Brazilians don’t believe in their 
              country’s future anymore. Some choose to leave the country to European 
              or Asian countries. The regular people, not only graduated profissional 
              researcher, have been doing it since the <i>2016 Crisis</i>. In case, 
              regular people leaving isn’t the consequence of the budget decrease. 
              The event only sums the reason the people have to do it. The effect of 
              the budget decrease is the “Brain trail” happening in the country. This 
              name is due to the lack of salary to scientists that make them chose 
              other countries to live and “give their brains” to other nations 
              research[8]. Scientists and experts are leaving because of the 
              sub-conditions of work the scientists, or their groups, are 
              submitted to. For example how the government didn’t provide 
              the budget to the Brazilian group contribute to the VLT(<i>Very large 
              Telescope</i>). The Brazilian participation of the VLT program was 
              suspended by ESO(<i>European Southern Observatory</i>) because of the 
              period between the countries accord in 2011 to the latest 2017 
              Brazil didn’t pay their entrance. According to Gustavo Rojas, 
              representant of the ESO’s Brazilian science disclosure, the 
              agreement happens between governments but before protocoled 
              inside the country. The process didn’t rise to international 
              levels due to the lake of presidential sanction. The accord 
              signed in 2011, but only ratificated by the Nacional Congress 
              in 2015, turned Brazil a“rising member”. Brazil as a “ rising 
              member” has been always treated as a valuable partner and will 
              be open to admit in future moments even after the event that lead 
              to the suspense.[7] This situation will never happen because of the 
              struggle between government and scientists interests.  To both 
              individual and researches survive,scientists search for countries 
              interested to house them and their knowledge. This knowledge will 
              never be used for Brazil’s own benefit and will in long terms decrease 
              its internal knowledge.
            Knowledge is a result of education. This one depends in extend part 
            on experts graduated in some level. Even more on Brazil, where 
            scientists try to bring easier ways to the population-highlighting 
            the young people- have access to knowledge and understanding about 
            the world around them to engage them about their surrounding. 
            Scientists are not only researches. Many of them dedicate their 
            lives teaching, mentioning from the primary school to universities. 
            Those teachers already receive low payment compared to other countries 
            like Germany, around €7,000 less referring to high school teachers 
            average[3]. They fight to bring the most efficient education and moral 
            values to the students and are the most frequent reference young people 
            have to intellectual people. They are the firsts to bring juvenile 
            interest to science and research areas such as health or engineering. 
            The decrease of the funding directly affects the professionals, 
            engineering and social science, on this area. They don’t have money 
            and consequently leave the country or need to find another jobs to 
            survive. This pattern makes the teenager instead of a desire to 
            follow in areas of science to reject the idea. The lack of money 
            makes them disinterested on the department. Consequently on the 
            future the rest of scientist trying to bring education will die 
            and no longer the country will have people able to spread knowledge 
            freely. In long terms it means Brazil will not have professionals 
            to exercise research and development functions in the country. Brazil 
            without researchers and developers will stagnate and delay compared 
            to other countries in result.
            Other countries, on the other hand, are also affected by Brazil’s 
            researchers' stagnation. Brazil has a relevant space on global 
            science because of its frequent active possition. Because of the 
            cutting, the national science and it works to contribute to other 
            countries in consequence is held.  For example, the UFRJ(Federal University of Rio de Janeiro) 
            laboratories that were studying Zika Vírus and microcephaly 
            that stopped their research because cannot care of pieces of 
            equipment. While it many countries in Asia and Africa are interested 
            in the research because of cases of the Virus into their countries. 
            Those can find other countries to continue this research. But Brazil 
            will be left behind into the exploration for better ways to live.
            Brazil isn't only misplaced into friendly areas related to science 
            because science isn’t only space exploration and health manutention. 
            It is related to transport, food production, recreation and economy. 
            For example into the exportation of Minerals and raw materials provision, 
            the country will be in a economical decicity because the international market
            would prefer a more efficient and actualized country to produce their provisions. 
            China in instance would and is replacing Brazil’s position on the Minerals  
            international market because of their investments into efficient production 
            and exportation.
            Brazilians don’t completely bare this event and its consequences. 
            Manifestation against government proclamation act on the 30th March 
            occurred on 08 October, 6 months after the proclamation[9]. The event 
            was divulged on the press and social media, furthermore, supported by 
            SBPC(brazilian society to the progress of science), Associação dos 
            pesquisadores científicos da sociedade de são paulo, USP, Unicamp and 
            other several institutes. Around 2.500 people participate of the 
            manifest. But the manifestation didn’t show effective results. 
            Resulting from this event, scientists still try flexible solutions to 
            sustains the country’s research department. Sometimes researchers can 
            faith to their outside country partners to help bring budget from their 
            country’s income.But many times it  isn’t enough to the research. 
            To solve it have been implemented many independent crowdfunding systems 
            to help Brazil’s scientific research. Like <i>Iguarapé Institute</i>[4], 
            <i>Entropia Coletiva</i>[5] or <i>Serrapilheira</i>[6]. Those platforms are usually 
            in the internet and some of them already work and have successful 
            public articles. Pherpase Partnerschafts can help to hold on the 
            innovacion and reduce the spending. But the situation cannot be 
            completely controlled without internal support of the Government 
            because of hesitancy in the researchers mind to absent of money will 
            prevail in their decisions.
            Brazil’s development will suffer of continuous effects on its 
            development due the absence of income and support from the government 
            for science. Even if the country quickly fix their  the actions many 
            people knowledgeable and essential to its development left and the 
            young, the molders of the future, are marked with the past 
            experiences. The research inside the country will stop and it will 
            also disturb Brazil’s global relationships. This event brings the 
            necessity of  intense investment on science to try 
            to soften the future consequences. If this be done, in a longer future 
            the might be saved from the decadence and its consequences.
